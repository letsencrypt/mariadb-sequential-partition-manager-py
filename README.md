# Partman

This tool partitions and manages MariaDB tables by sequential IDs.

This is primarily a mechanism for dropping large numbers of rows of data without using `DELETE` statements.

Adding partitions in the first place with InnoDB requires a full table copy. Otherwise, the `REORGANIZE PARTITION` command is fast only if operating on a partition that is empty, e.g., has no rows.

Similar tools:
* https://github.com/davidburger/gomypartition, intended for tables with date-based partitions
* https://github.com/yahoo/mysql_partition_manager, which is archived and in pure SQL

### Running `partman` in your development environment

```sh
 → git clone https://github.com/letsencrypt/mariadb-sequential-partition-manager-py.git
 → cd mariadb-sequential-partition-manager-py
 → python3 -m venv .venv
 → . .venv/bin/activate
 → python3 -m pip install --editable ".[pymysql]"
 → partition-manager --log-level=debug  \
    --mariadb test_tools/fake_mariadb.sh \
    maintain --noop --table tablename
DEBUG:root:Auto_Increment column identified as id
DEBUG:root:Partition range column identified as id
DEBUG:root:Found partition before = (100)
DEBUG:root:Found tail partition named p_20201204
INFO:root:No-op mode

ALTER TABLE `dbname`.`tablename` REORGANIZE PARTITION `p_20201204` INTO (PARTITION `p_20201204` VALUES LESS THAN (3101009), PARTITION `p_20210122` VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE);
```

## Configuration
You can use a yaml configuration file with the `--config` parameter of the form:

```yaml
partitionmanager:
  dburl: sql://user:password@localhost/db-name
  # or
  # mariadb: /usr/local/bin/mariadb
  partition_period:
    days: 7
  num_empty: 2

  tables:
    table1:
      retention:
        days: 60
      earliest_utc_timestamp_query: >
        SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created) FROM table1 WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1;
    table2:
      partition_period:
        days: 30
      earliest_utc_timestamp_query: >
        SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created) FROM table2 WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1;
    table3:
      retention:
        days: 14
      earliest_utc_timestamp_query: >
        SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP(created) FROM table3 WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1;
    table4: {}
```

The `earliest_utc_timestamp_query` entries are optional SQL queries that are run during partition map analysis to determine the eact timestamp of the earliest entry in each partition. If you configure such a query for a table, it must return a single row and column, specifically the epoch timestamp in UTC of the earliest entry the partition. There is expcected a single `?` entry which will be replaced with the partition value of that partition.

For tables which are either partitioned but not yet using this tool's schema, or which have no empty partitions, the `migrate` command can be useful for proposing alterations to run manually. Note that `migrate` proposes commands that are likely to require partial copies of each table, so likely they will require a maintenance period.

```sh
partition-manager --mariadb ~/bin/rootsql-dev-primary migrate --out /tmp/migrate.yml --table orders
INFO:write_state_info:Writing current state information
INFO:write_state_info:(Table("orders"): {'id': 9236}),

# wait some time
partition-manager --mariadb ~/bin/rootsql-dev-primary migrate --in /tmp/migrate.yml --table orders
INFO:calculate_sql_alters:Reading prior state information
INFO:calculate_sql_alters:Table orders, 24.0 hours, [9236] - [29236], [20000] pos_change, [832.706363653845]/hour
orders:
 - ALTER TABLE `orders` REORGANIZE PARTITION `p_20210405` INTO (PARTITION `p_20210416` VALUES LESS THAN (30901), PARTITION `p_20210516` VALUES LESS THAN (630449), PARTITION `p_20210615` VALUES LESS THAN MAXVALUE);
```

## Getting started

### Configuring `partman`

- At start, if any configuration file specified as a CLI argument, read that configuration file to set all other values.
- Then, process all remaining command line arguments, overriding values loaded from the configuration file in case of conflicts.
- From those command-line arguments, determine whether to collect statistics `stats`, determine an initial partition layout `migrate`, or operate in the normal `maintain` mode.
- Use the configuration information as inputs to the required algorithm.

### How does `partman` determine when an additional partition is needed?

The core algorithm is implemented in a method `get_pending_sql_reorganize_partition_commands` in `table_append_partition.py`. That algorithm is:

For a given table and that table's intended partition period, desired end-state is to have:
- All the existing partitions containing data,
- A configurable number of trailing partitions which contain no data, and
- An "active" partition currently being filled with data

To make it easier to manage, we give all the filled partitions a name to indicate the approximate date that partition began being filled with data. This date is approximate because once a partition contains data, it is no longer an instant `ALTER` operation to rename the partition, rather every contained row gets copied, so this tool predicts the date at which the new partition will become the "active" one.

Inputs:
- The table name
- The intended partition period
- The number of trailing partitions to keep
- The table's current partition list
- The table's partition id's current value(s)

Outputs:
- An intended partition list, changing only the empty partitions, or
- If no partitions can be reorganized, an error.

Procedure:
- Using the current values, split the partition list into two sub-lists: empty partitions, and non-empty partitions.
- If there are no empty partitions:
  - Raise an error and halt the algorithm.

- Perform a statistical regression using each non-empty partition to determine each partition's fill rate.
- Using each partition's fill rate and their age, predict the future partition fill rate.
- Create a new list of intended empty partitions.
- For each empty partition:
  - Predict the start-of-fill date using the partition's position relative to the current active partition, the current active partition's date, the partition period, and the future partition fill rate.
  - If the start-of-fill date is different than the partition's name, rename the partition.
  - Append the changed partition to the intended empty partition list.
- While the number of empty partitions is less than the intended number of trailing partitions to keep:
  - Predict the start-of-fill date for a new partition using the previous partition's date and the partition period.
  - Append the new partition to the intended empty partition list.
- Return the lists of non-empty partitions, the current empty partitions, and the post-algorithm intended empty partitions.

#### How do I run `partman` in `noop` mode?

The results of the algorithm are converted into `ALTER` statements; if the user configured `--noop` they're emitted to console and the logs for each table. If not set to `--noop`, the application will execute the ALTERs at the database server and emit the results, including execution time as prometheus statistics if so configured.

#### "Migrate" algorithm

The migrate mode is a limited form of the "Maintain" Algorithm, using a temporary state file to determine rates-of-change. The migrate mode also does not limit itself to only affecting empty partitions, it can and will request changes that will prompt row copies, in order to prepare a table for future use of the "Maintain" algorithm.

## TODOs

Lots:
- [x] Support for tables with partitions across multiple columns.
- [ ] A drop mechanism, for one. Initially it should take a retention period and log proposed `DROP` statements, not perform them.
- [ ] Yet more tests, particularly live integration tests with a test DB.
